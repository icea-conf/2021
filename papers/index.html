                        <p style="text-align: justify">Developing an effective and efficient artificial intelligent method for enhancing the performance of an intelligent system has been a critical issue today, because several studies on deep learning and intelligent system have shown the possibilities of artificial intelligence technologies in recent years. Besides developing more useful supervised/unsupervised learning algorithms to enhance the performance of an intelligent system, how to adopt cloud computing and GPU technologies to accelerate the performance of such systems has attracted the attention of researchers from different disciplines. One emerging application is to apply these technologies to an internet of things system to make it “smart” or even “intelligent.” These emerging intelligent applications can also be found in data mining, networking, network security, smart city, and many applications in our daily life. The ACM ICEA 2021 provides an open platform for researchers from different countries to exchange their research results, experiences, and opinions in the topics on intelligent computing and other relevant emerging applications. This conference features all recent advances in an integral concept that highlights the trends in search algorithms, systems, and applications in intelligent computing.</p>
